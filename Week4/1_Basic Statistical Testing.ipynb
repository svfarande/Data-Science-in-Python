    "When we do hypothesis testing, we actually have two statements of interest: the first is our actual explanation, which we call the alternative hypothesis, and the second is that the explanation we have is not sufficient, and we call this the null hypothesis. Our actual testing method is to determine whether the null hypothesis is true or not. If we find that there is a difference between groups, then we can reject the null hypothesis and we accept our alternative."

    "Ok, these look pretty similar. But, are they the same? What do we mean by similar? This is where the students' t-test comes in. It allows us to form the alternative hypothesis (\"These are different\") as well as the null hypothesis (\"These are the same\") and then test that null hypothesis.  When doing hypothesis testing, we have to choose a significance level as a threshold for how much of a chance we're willing to accept. This significance level is typically called alpha. For this example, let's use a threshold of 0.05 for our alpha or 5%. Now this is a commonly used number but it's really quite arbitrary.  The SciPy library contains a number of different statistical tests and forms a basis for hypothesis testing in Python and we're going to use the ttest_ind() function which does an independent t-test (meaning the populations are not related to one another). The result of ttest_index() are the t-statistic and a p-value. It's this latter value, the probability, which is most important to us, as it indicates the chance (between 0 and 1) of our null hypothesis being True."

Let's take a look at those p-values for a moment though, because they are saying things that can inform experimental design down the road. For instance, one of the assignments, assignment 3, has a p-value around 0.1. This means that if we accepted a level of chance similarity of 11% this would have been considered statistically significant. As a research, this would suggest to me that there is something here worth considering following up on.
